## Results
### February, May, and June are the top three months for successful campaigns
### January, July and October are the top three months for failed campaigns
### Theater campaigns are the most campaigns, followed by Music and film categories
### In the Theater Category, Plays are the most successful campaigns having huge margin over Musicals and Spaces
### Descriptive Statistics results show that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. Also, Louise Kickstarter goal is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this doesn't look good. 
### Results from measure of Spread analysis shows that some large values, i.e., outliers are driving all of these distributions
